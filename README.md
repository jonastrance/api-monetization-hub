# API Monetization Hub

API Monetization Hub is a comprehensive platform that transforms any REST API into a revenue-generating product by providing built-in billing, usage tracking, rate limiting, and developer portal functionality. Developers can connect their existing APIs through simple webhooks, set flexible pricing tiers (per-call, monthly subscriptions, or usage-based), and immediately start accepting payments from API consumers. The platform includes analytics dashboards showing revenue metrics, popular endpoints, and customer behavior patterns, along with automated documentation generation and API key management. Revenue is generated through a revenue-share model where the platform takes 8-12% of all API transactions, creating passive income that scales with customer API usage. Additional monetization comes from premium features like custom domains ($29/month), advanced analytics ($79/month), and white-label options for agencies who want to offer API monetization services to their clients ($299/month per agency).
